# 📊 Job & Salary Analysis – Excel Data Analytics Project

## 📁 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of job postings, focusing on **roles, required skills, and salary trends**. Using Excel, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the data to extract key insights and built an **interactive dashboard** to visualize the findings. The goal was to understand how skills, job roles, and salaries are interrelated in the current job market.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Power Query for data cleaning
  - Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
  - Slicers and Filters
  - Conditional Formatting
  - Formulas & Functions (e.g., `XLOOKUP`, `SUMIFS`, `TEXTJOIN`)

---

## 📌 Key Features
- **Cleaned & Structured Raw Job Postings Data**
- **Categorized Job Titles** by type (Analyst, Engineer, Scientist, etc.)
- **Mapped Skills to Job Roles** and counted frequency
- **Visualized Salary Trends** across roles, industries, and skillsets
- **Created Interactive Views** to slice and analyze:
  - Job Role vs Median Salary
  - Number of Skills vs Salary
  - Skill Distribution per Role
  - Top Paying Roles and many more...

---

## 🔍 Insights Derived
- 📈 There is a positive correlation between the number of skills requested and the median salary, especially in roles like **Senior Data Engineer** and **Data Scientist**.
- 💼 Roles requiring fewer skills, such as **Business Analyst**, generally offer lower compensation, indicating the **market value of specialization**.
- ⚖️ **Analyst** and **Scientist** roles can offer **comparable salaries to Engineering roles** while requiring **fewer skills**, suggesting an easier path to equal pay.

4. **Skill Frequency Mapping** – Visual breakdown of most in-demand skills  

### 📊 Interactive Salary Dashboard

This dynamic Excel dashboard provides a comprehensive view of job market trends across **job titles**, **countries**, and **employment types**.  
- I used **data validation dropdowns** to control and filter key parameters like **Job Role**, **Country**, and **Job Type**, allowing users to explore specific segments interactively.  
- Key insights such as **median salary**, **top job platform**, and **job count** are displayed with visual charts and summary cards for quick interpretation.

 ### 🌍 Median Salary Comparison by Country

This table compares **median salaries** for each job role across:
- 🌎 **US-based roles**
- 🌐 **Non-US roles**
- 🌍 The **selected country**, controlled by the interactive slicer on the right

The **`Median Salary`** column dynamically updates based on the country selected using the slicer (`job_country`), allowing a clear view of how salaries vary internationally.

### 🛠️ Skill Demand vs Salary Analysis

This dual-axis chart analyzes the **top 10 most in-demand skills** based on job postings.  
- The **bars** represent the **median salary** associated with each skill.
- The **diamond markers** represent the **likelihood** (percentage) of that skill appearing in job listings.

This visual helps identify which skills offer **high earning potential** and how **commonly** they are required, enabling data-driven decisions for upskilling.
